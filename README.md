Hi, I am Bryan Dominguez

As a kid growing up software and game development has been something that I have always been passionate about.
I can still remember having to blow air into my Super Smash Bros cartridge in order for it to work into my Nintendo 64 and seeing the game boot up for the first time...

This passion of playing video games and working with computers has carried onto my education at Lane Tech College Prep where it helped me decided that I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science.
Currently, I am a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago where I study new languages, work with others on challenging projects and build personal projects with those I have met so far in my college life.

Now, as I am a couple years from graduation, I have started learning UNIX operating systems, learning new languages and I have started a personal project where I am building and designing a video game with a group of people. Moreover, I am excited to continue to learn exciting languages and tools in my later years...
